For your data files, ensure they are 3 column vectors of the form: [q, I, Err].
You should copy your data and click paste in MATLAB's 'workspace'.
Set the file type to 'Numerical Matrix', rename the file to something appropriate
and click import. Then in the workspace, right click your file and save as the same name as the matrix.
Make sure that the file is saved in the same place as the model for MATLAB to find the file.

It may be possible to set up a more elaborate loading system, but this has not been implemented.

Now when you load your file, you just need to type in the name of the file in the loadfile lines
