# SANS-1D-Models
This repository is a collection of models to fit smallâ€“angle neutron scattering data, using MATLAB.

Models currently coded in MATLAB are: \
Flexible cylinder model + PRISM (with a levenberg-marquardt fitter)\
Flexible elliptical cylinder model + PRISM (with a levenberg-marquardt fitter)\
Ellipsoidal model\
Ellipsoidal model + Hayter-Penfold-Hansen-Ginoza Structure factor (charged particles)\
\
Models to be uploaded shortly:\
Spherical model\
Spherical model + Hayter-Penfold-Hansen-Ginoza Structure factor (charged particles)
